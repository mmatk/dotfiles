Just a place to keep my personal dotfiles.

vim:

Create a symbolic link from the vimrc file within the root of the repo to
~/.vimrc and another from the vim directory within the repo root to ~/.vim.

All plugins are maintained as git submodules. These can be updated using:

git submodule foreach git pull origin master

And new ones can be installed by cd'ing into the root of the repo and issuing:

git submodule add https://someurl.com/somerepo vim/bundle/somerepo
